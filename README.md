## Overview

The **Empathy Framework** is a systematic approach to building AI systems that progress from reactive responses to anticipatory problem prevention. By integrating emotional intelligence (Goleman), tactical empathy (Voss), systems thinking (Meadows, Senge), and clear reasoning (Naval Ravikant), it provides a maturity model for AI-human collaboration.

**Empathy**, in this context, is not about feelings—it's about:
- **Alignment**: Understanding the human's goals, context, and constraints
- **Prediction**: Anticipating future needs based on system trajectory
- **Timely Action**: Intervening at the right moment with the right support

## The Five Levels

| Level | Name | Core Behavior | Timing | Example |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|---------|
| **1** | **Reactive** | Help after being asked | Lagging | "You asked for data, here it is" |
| **2** | **Guided** | Collaborative exploration | Real-time | "Let me ask clarifying questions" |
| **3** | **Proactive** | Act before being asked | Leading | "I pre-fetched what you usually need" |
| **4** | **Anticipatory** | Predict future needs | Predictive | "Next week's audit is coming—docs ready" |
| **5** | **Systems** | Build structures that help at scale | Structural | "I designed a framework for all future cases" |
