# Archived: Files with Inaccurate Claims

**Archived**: January 9, 2026
**Reason**: Contained unverifiable claims

## Why These Were Archived

These marketing files contained claims that could not be verified:

- ❌ "Tracked over 30 days" - No 30-day controlled study was conducted
- ❌ "-62% standards violations" - Not precisely measured
- ❌ "-75% linter errors" - Not precisely measured
- ❌ "80 hours/month saved" - Rough estimate, not tracked
- ❌ "Measured results after 30 days" - v3.9.3 released 2 days ago

## What's Wrong

The metrics were based on internal development experience over several months, not a controlled study. Presenting them as "30-day measurements" or "tracked metrics" was misleading.

## Correct Approach

See the replacement files:
- `TWITTER_THREAD_V3_9_3.md` - Only verifiable claims
- `V3_9_3_CAMPAIGN.md` - Honest, technical messaging
- `RESPONSE_TEMPLATES_ACCURATE.md` - Verified claims only

## Principle Going Forward

**Only claim what's verifiable:**
- ✅ 174 security tests (count them in codebase)
- ✅ 0 current vulnerabilities (run security scan)
- ✅ 100/100 health score (verifiable)
- ✅ +1,143% test coverage increase (14 → 174)

**Don't claim:**
- ❌ Time savings (too context-dependent)
- ❌ ROI percentages (varies by user)
- ❌ Adoption metrics (too early)
- ❌ Unverified measurements

Let the technical achievements speak. Users decide value.
