# LinkedIn Announcement: Empathy Framework v2.3

## Just shipped: AI that remembers you AND costs 80% less

Every AI conversation starts from scratch. Preferences forgotten. Context lost.

And you're paying Opus prices ($15/M tokens) for tasks Haiku could handle ($0.25/M).

I built Empathy Framework to fix both. v2.3 just shipped.

**What's new:**

**1. Smart Model Routing (80% savings)**
Auto-picks Haiku/Sonnet/Opus based on task complexity.
Real numbers: $4.05/task → $0.83/task

**2. Persistent Memory**
Preferences survive across sessions. Bug patterns accumulate. Your AI actually learns.

**3. Claude Code Integration**
`empathy sync-claude` syncs patterns to `.claude/rules/` — Claude Code loads your team's history at session start.

---

**Quick start:**

```
pip install empathy-framework
```
